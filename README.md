# Garbage Segregation


1. Project Overview
- This notebook implements a garbage segregation model using the Xception architecture. It incorporates both image and gas sensor data and trains for 100 epochs.

2. Dependencies Installation
- pip install tensorflow matplotlib seaborn gdown numpy pandas

4. Data Download & Extraction
- The dataset is downloaded from Google Drive using gdown.
- The ZIP file is extracted to a working directory.

6. Data Preprocessing
- Images are verified for proper formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP, etc.).
- The dataset directory structure is checked.
- Data augmentation techniques applied.

8. Model Definition
- The notebook uses the Xception model for image feature extraction.
- Additional layers are added to integrate gas sensor data.

10. Model Training
- The model is trained for 100 epochs.
- Training includes loss function evaluation and accuracy tracking.

12. Model Evaluation
- Performance metrics like accuracy and loss are visualized.

13. Model Inference
- The trained model is used to predict garbage categories based on new image and gas sensor inputs.

14. Results & Observations
- Final accuracy and performance analysis.
- Potential improvements for better classification.
